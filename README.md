# Intelligent Goal-Point Tracking and Navigation system

In this project we aim to create an intelligent agent to track a goal point in a 2D environment. The agent will be able to navigate through the environment and reach the goal point. The goal point itself may be moving or stationary. The agent will be able to track the goal point and reach it in the shortest possible time.
Every time the agent reaches the goal point, the goal point will be moved to a new location. The agent will then track the new goal point and reach it. This process will continue indefinitely.
We have also introduced a feature of the goal point's speed increasing every time the agent reaches it. This will make the task more challenging for the agent.
